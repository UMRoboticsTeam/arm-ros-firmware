In order to work on RaspberryPi (aarch64-based), you must build your own ROS image
Note: for now, we are using the desktop flavour of ROS Humble
To do this:
	git clone https://github.com/osrf/docker_images
	cd docker_images/ros/humble/ubuntu/jammy
	cd desktop
	docker build -t ros-humble-desktop --platform=linux/aarch64 .
Now we have a docker image called "ros-humble-desktop" that works on RPi
